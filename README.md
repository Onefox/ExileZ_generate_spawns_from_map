#This is now using a new custom format for my own ExileZ version!
The fromat is "[[6693.92, 2583.52], 35, "namecitycapital"]"
Coods, amount of units and a description, you can just change it a bit to fit in your custom format.

I use the description to let different zeds spawn on different points, also they have different loot. and so one. The possibilities are endless.



# Gernate Zombie spawn positions for ExileZ Arma3

This script will take a look at all map names and find so positions in every town for example. This is ideal to get zombie spawnpoints.


I got the idea from FACEs A3XAI (here is a mirror link since he took his down. https://github.com/MrIrishMan/A3XAI-UPLOAD)


To use this just open your favorit map in the normal arma editor and go into preview and run this script.

It should generate spawn positions and save them to your clip board.
You can use them for the ExileZ script from @Captainjack (https://github.com/rscaptainjack/ZOMBIES_CODE)
