# ExileZ_generate_spawns_from_map

I got the idea from FACEs A3XAI (here is a mirror link since he took his down. https://github.com/MrIrishMan/A3XAI-UPLOAD)


To use this just open your favorit map in the normal arma editor and go into preview and run this script.

It should generate spawn positions and save them to your clip board.
You can use them for the ExileZ script from @Captainjack (https://github.com/rscaptainjack/ZOMBIES_CODE)
